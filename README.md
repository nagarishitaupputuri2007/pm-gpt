PM-GPT is an AI-powered **Product Management Copilot** that transforms ambiguous product challenges into **structured insights, prioritized feature decisions, and defensible product roadmaps**.

This project is intentionally built to reflect **real-world product management thinking**, not surface-level automation. Every output mirrors how experienced Product Managers analyze problems, reason through trade-offs, and communicate decisions clearly to stakeholders and leadership.

> **Note:** This project was built as a **flagship portfolio project** to demonstrate **real-world product management decision-making**, not as a tutorial or toy application.

## ✨ Key Capabilities

### 🎯 Problem Analysis
- Identifies the true core problem behind vague or noisy product signals  
- Maps user pain points, friction areas, and failure modes  
- Frames problems using impact, urgency, and real-world constraints  

### 🛠 Feature Ideation
- Generates realistic, high-leverage solution ideas  
- Aligns features with problem archetypes and business context  
- Avoids speculative or impractical product thinking  

### ⚖️ Smart Prioritization
- Selects the most appropriate framework (RICE, ICE, Kano, MoSCoW)  
- Explains *why* a specific framework fits the situation  
- Enables side-by-side comparison of prioritization outcomes  

### 📊 Decision Intelligence
- Simulates executive and stakeholder pushback  
- Documents trade-offs, risks, and rejected alternatives  
- Produces PM-grade narratives suitable for reviews and interviews  

### 📅 Roadmap Generation
- Builds a realistic 6-month product roadmap  
- Balances strategy, execution, and resource constraints  
- Exports a professional PDF with full decision reasoning
