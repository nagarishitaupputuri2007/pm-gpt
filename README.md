# PM-GPT — Product Management Copilot 🚀

PM-GPT is an AI-powered Product Management copilot that helps transform ambiguous product problems into **structured insights, prioritized feature decisions, and defensible product roadmaps**.

This project is built to reflect **real-world PM thinking**, not just automation. Every output is designed to mirror how strong Product Managers reason, communicate trade-offs, and justify decisions.

## Why PM-GPT?

Product decisions often fail not because of a lack of ideas — but because of:
- unclear problem framing  
- weak prioritization logic  
- poor articulation of trade-offs  
- decisions that don’t hold up under leadership scrutiny  

PM-GPT addresses this gap by guiding users through a **PM-grade decision pipeline**, producing outputs that are structured, explainable, and leadership-ready.

## What PM-GPT Does

PM-GPT walks through the complete product decision lifecycle:

### 1. Problem Insight
- Identifies the core product problem  
- Highlights where users fail  
- Surfaces business impact and execution constraints  
- Defines success clearly  

### 2. Feature Generation
- Generates solution ideas aligned to the problem type  
- Focuses on actionable, realistic product interventions  

### 3. Framework Selection
- Automatically selects the right prioritization framework (RICE, ICE, Kano, MoSCoW)  
- Explains *why* the framework fits the problem  
- Allows manual override for comparison  

### 4. Feature Prioritization
- Scores features using PM-relevant signals  
- Produces ranked outputs suitable for roadmap planning  

### 5. Roadmap Creation
- Converts priorities into a structured 6-month roadmap  
- Keeps scope and sequencing realistic  

### 6. Decision Review (Flagship Feature)
- Explains reasoning behind decisions  
- Documents trade-offs, risks, and rejected alternatives  
- Simulates leadership pushback and PM responses  

### 7. Export
- Generates a professional PDF containing the full analysis  
- Suitable for reviews, interviews, or stakeholder discussions
