PM-GPT is an AI-powered **Product Management Copilot** that transforms ambiguous product challenges into **structured insights, prioritized feature decisions, and defensible product roadmaps**.

This project is intentionally built to reflect **real-world PM thinking**, not surface-level automation. Every output mirrors how experienced Product Managers analyze problems, reason through trade-offs, and communicate decisions clearly to stakeholders and leadership.
